Algorithm:

1. Start.

2. Read expense data from input source (e.g., user input, file, or database).

3. Create multiple threads to process expenses concurrently.

4. Each thread executes the expense processing logic in parallel.

5. Implement proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety while accessing and modifying shared resources, including the Expense objects.

6. Generate reports or visualizations based on the processed expense data.

7. Store the processed data and reports in a cloud-based data storage service (e.g., Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, or Amazon S3).

8. Handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the expense processing and data storage steps.

9. End the threads and terminate the application.

10. Stop.
